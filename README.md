# Wireless-Sensors-in-IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is going to change our world. It is estimated that there will be
nearly 22 billion IoT devices by 2025. Extending internet connectivity to everyday objects will
transform industries and create tremendous cost savings. But how do non-internet-enabled devices
gain connectivity capabilities? and the answer is through wireless sensors.
With wireless sensors, the IoT is possible. Individuals and organizations can use wireless sensors
to enable many dierent kinds of smart applications. From interconnected homes to smart cities,
wireless sensors create the infrastructure upon which the IoT comes alive.
